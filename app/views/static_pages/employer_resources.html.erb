<h2>On the Job Training</h2>

<p>Both <%= link_to 'on-the-job training (OJT) and apprenticeship programs', on_the_job_training_path %> are available for Veterans using their VA education benefits, including <a href="http://www.giBill.va.gov/" target="_blank">the Post-9/11 GI Bill<span class="sup">Â®</span><%= image_tag "new_window.gif", class: "external", alt: "Opens in a new window." %></a>. These programs allow Veterans to learn a trade or skill through training on the job participation rather than attending formal classroom instruction.</p>

<p>A Veteran generally enters into a training contract for a specific period with an employer or union, and at the end of the training period, the Veteran gains job certification or journeyman status.</p>

<p>Employers participtating in an <abbr>OJT</abbr> program are able to hire a Veteran at the apprenticeship wage and have the salary supplemented by VA. The training often results in permanenet full-time employment and provides employers with a well-trained Veteran employee.</p>
