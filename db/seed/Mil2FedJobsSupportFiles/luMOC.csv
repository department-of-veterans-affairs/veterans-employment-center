Basic understanding of surface warfare must also include a knowledge of the operations of the various ship types within the surface force including carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, amphibious, mine warfare and combat logistics force ships. At the senior level, appreciation of air and submarine warfare, as well as inter-type and joint operations in a multi-threat environment is essential, especially in operations From The Sea. Those who qualify as a SWO are authorized to wear the Surface Warfare Officer Breast Insignia and are designated 111X. Officers in training for this warfare specialty are designated 116X. The Surface Warfare career path is structured to provide officers with a continuum of training and professional opportunities both within and outside of their specific warfare specialty. A broad base of assignments such as student and staff billets at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) at Service Colleges, instructor duty at various Navy schools and NROTC units, recruiting duty, acquisition assignments, and a number of other unique positions ashore, both within the continental United States and abroad, complement basic warfare training.

The fundamental goal of the nuclear trained submarine officer is to develop the professional skills and operational background to command a nuclear submarine. The achievement of this goal is accomplished through a well defined series of professional qualifications, advanced training and operational sea experience. The General Submarine Officer is a submarine warfare specialist within the unrestricted line. As a GSO, your professional development should provide the broad experience necessary for sea command and senior management assignments both inside and outside the submarine community.

"Navy","Officer","169","DESIGNATOR","Active","RL - Special Duty - Merchant Marine, Communications","The mission of the General Unrestricted Line (URL) Community is to provide the Navy with a community of officers of proven leadership, shore management and subspecialty expertise who manage the increasingly complex fleet support establishment in direct support of the Navy's warfighting mission. Primary career milestones for the General URL officer are as follows: with 0-10 Years of Service (YOS) includes a Division Officer tour, a Department Head Tour, and Subspecialty Development through Experience Tour and/or Navy Post Graduate School; with 10-15 YOS includes an XO Tour, and a proven subspecialty; with 15-21 YOS includes a Commander Command Tour, a Joint Specialist Designation, and a Subspecialty Utilization; and with 21-26 YOS includes a Major Shore Command Tour. Strong performance in both leadership and subspecialty billets is the traditional path to career success for promotion for General URL officers. However, increasingly technical Navy argues for earlier and more intensive subspecialization by General URL officers involving areas of shore management such as command, control and communications (C3), computer systems, integrated undersea surveillance (IUSS), manpower, personnel and training (MPT), financial management, operational logistics and space systems. As a General URL officer, one develops leadership skills through assignment to jobs of increasing levels of responsibility and authority which involve supervision of personnel (officer, enlisted and/or civilians) coupled with the management of resources (finances, equipment, property, etc.). Subspecialty development is achieved through formal graduate level education and/or significant experience tours in a subspecialty field. In some cases, leadership and subspecialty development may be combined in a single tour, such as in the areas of communications, underseas surveillance and education and training.",NULL

Forecasting atmospheric and oceanic parameters and the charting/geodesy of the earth and ocean floor are all important functions of this effort. The community is composed of 450 naval officers with specialized training or education in oceanography, many of whom are warfare qualified. Oceanographers are expected to successfully complete a Master of Science degree in an oceanographic discipline with most education being received from the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) prior to promotion to the rank of commander. A select few will obtain Ph.D., either at NPS or through the ONR Fellowship Program at civilian institutions. The community also serves at sea in direct support of the fleet onboard aircraft carriers, amphibious ships, battleships, on numbered fleet staffs, submarine and cruiser-destroyer group staffs, or conduct strategic scientific ocean surveys onboard the Navy's Oceanographic Survey Ships. Shore duty includes worldwide assignments in over 60 locations, with billets concentrated at onboard operational naval air stations, naval stations, Fleet Headquarters, and Naval Oceanography Command units.

Instead, there are types of assignments ordered around three critical operational gates. The typical tours you can expect within the Intelligence community are: FIRST TOUR - All first tour officers go to operational units (sea duty) for 24 to 36 months. Male officers go to aviation squadrons or ships, primarily aircraft carriers. Women officers are assigned to patrol squadrons (VP) or ASWOCs overseas.; SECOND/THIRD TOUR - Shore tours last about 24-36 months and deal primarily with Operational Intelligence (OPINTEL) or joint intelligence; THIRD/FOURTH TOUR - This is the second operational tour and is approximately 24 months in duration. Male officers go to Air Wing/Staff/Ship intelligence billets. Women officers are assigned to PATWINGS, VQ Squadrons or SUBGRUs; FOURTH/FIFTH TOUR - Shore tours of 36 months dealing with Navy OPINTEL, joint duty, professional military education, attache duty or other types of billets; FIFTH/SIXTH TOUR - The third critical operational tour lasts approximately 24 months. Male officers are assigned to afloat staffs or CV/CVN N-2 billets. Women are assigned to senior intelligence billets at PATWINGS, VQ-l/VQ-2, CTF-72 or CTF-67; FOLLOW-ON TOURS - Expect assignments to be similar to ashore senior intelligence billet, either Navy or joint in CONUS or overseas, each lasting about 36 months; CAPT - Command of Intelligence shore establishments, CINC or numbered fleet N-2, Washington or overseas duty in Joint or Navy areas.

JAG officers are first commissioned in either the JAG Corps Student program, during law school, or enter active duty directly from private practice, after having completed law school and been licensed to practice law. Another source of talent is our Law Education program (LEP), which offers paid legal educations to officers already commissioned in other designators. All of these individuals are provided training internships, where possible, prior to attending Naval Justice School (NJS) and being ordered to extended active duty. The NJS training is a nine-week course that prepares newly commissioned Navy attorneys for the broad range of legal duties they will assume as JAG Corps officers. Navy JAG officers, other than LEP program participants, incur a three year active duty obligation after completion on Naval Justice School. LAP students incur a two year obligation for each year of funded legal education they are provided. After completing NJS judge advocates are normally assigned to a Naval Legal Service Officer, either in CONUS or overseas, where they are trained in credentialed for further independent duty throughout the world. Their first exposure to the practice of law in the Navy usually involves trying courts-martial, serving as trial counsel representing the government, or as a defense counsel for the accused. Investigations, claims, legal assistance and command support assignments and responsibilities offer the opportunity for other experience, outside the courtroom. Later tours as an independent duty staff judge advocate to a station commander, or afloat on a tender or as assistant legal officer on a carrier, serve to further develop officers during their initial obligated service period.",NULL
